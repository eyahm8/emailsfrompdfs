
Since every other script was outdated or/and with depreceated dependecies it was faster to just put together my own.

Script runs through all folders, subfolders and files recursively in given location and extracts email addresses.


## How

1) pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2) in the extract.py file replace 'your_directory_path' with the path to the root directory containing your PDF files
3) python3 extract.py
4) collect emails
